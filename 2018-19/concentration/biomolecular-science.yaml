    message:
      Participation in an experimentally based research experience or employment
      that takes biomolecular sciences beyond the traditional classroom is
      required of each concentrator. This can occur either on- or off-campus.
      This activity must be pre-approved by the Biomolecular Science Committee
      and be supported after the fact by a letter from a supervisor.
