    message:
      Participation in an experimentally based research experience or
      employment that takes biomolecular sciences beyond the traditional
      classroom is required of each concentrator. This can occur either on- or
      off-campus. This activity must be pre-approved by the Biomolecular
      Science Committee and be supported after the fact by a letter from a
      supervisor.
