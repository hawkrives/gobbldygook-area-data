  Interdisciplinary Seminar:
    message: >
      LAMST 333 is taught in *alternate* years, and is ideally taken in the
      junior or senior year. Students planning to study abroad during the
      semester in which the course is taught should in their junior year
      petition the Latin American studies director to take an alternative
      course or independent study to fulfill this requirement during their
      senior year.
    result:
      course: LAMST 333
