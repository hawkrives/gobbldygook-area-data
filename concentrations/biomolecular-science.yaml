Core:
  # BIO 150 Evolutionary Foundations of Biodiversity
  # BIO 227 Cell Biology 1
  # BIO 233 Intermediate Genetics
  # BMOLS 201 Explorations in Biomolecular Science
  # CHEM 125  Structural Chemistry and Equilibrium [^1][^2]
  # CHEM 126  Energies and Rates of Chemical Reactions [^1]
  # CHEM 247  Organic Chemistry I
  #   & CHEM 253  Synthesis Laboratory I
  # CHEM 248  Organic Chemistry II
  #   & CHEM 254  Synthesis Laboratory II
  # CHEM 379  Biochemistry I

  # [^1]: CH/BI 125, CH/BI 126 and CH/BI 227 can substitute for CHEM 125, CHEM 126, and BIO 227.
  # [^2]: CHEM 121 and CHEM 123 can substitute for CHEM 125
  # That's what this line does.
  # CHEM 125 or 121+123, plus 126 and BIO 227, OR all of those can be substituted for the CH/BI sequence.

Experiential Learning:
  message:
    Participation in an experimentally based research experience or employment
    that takes biomolecular sciences beyond the traditional classroom is
    required of each concentrator. This can occur either on- or off-campus.
    This activity must be pre-approved by the Biomolecular Science Committee
    and be supported after the fact by a letter from a supervisor.

Electives:
  message:
    CHEM 391 and BIO 391 require approval of department in order to apply to
    the concentration. BIO 391 may be taken more than once if the subject
    matter is different.
