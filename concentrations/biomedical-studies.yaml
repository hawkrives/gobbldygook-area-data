Foundation:
  BIO 123 | 243

Practical Application:
  student selected: true
  message: Must be outside your major.
  description:
    It is any course in which the student practices something practical
    or logistical relating to the health career of interest. For example,
    many pre-dental students take a course in studio art to practice
    working with their hands. As another example, many pre-medical
    students take a health economics course to better understand the
    context of health care.


Ethical Considerations:
  student selected: true
  message: May be your EIN for GE.
  description:
    This is requirement is fulfilled through the EIN general education
    requirement. Several of the EIN courses focus on health related topics,
    such as PHIL 250 Biomedical Ethics and PHIL 259 Global Health Ethics.
    However, students can count any EIN designated course for this
    requirement, because the practice of ethical considerations is
    transferable to health care no matter what the original context in which
    it was learned.

Elective:
  student selected: true
  message: Must be outside your major.
  description:
    Any 200- or 300-level course that contributes to the student's career
    preparation. For example, many students preparing for graduate programs in
    occupational therapy take a 200-level psychology course, and many students
    interested in health administration take a course that focuses on
    socioeconomic or cultural diversity.

Experiential Learning:
  message:
    Students must participate in at least one significant experience that
    provides immersion in the biomedical field(s) being considered.

Senior Capstone Review:
  message:
    Students must write a one-page review of how their work in the biomedical
    studies concentration has helped formulate next steps for after
    graduation from St. Olaf College.
