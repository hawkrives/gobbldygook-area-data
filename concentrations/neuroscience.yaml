        Another appropriate advanced science course with advanced
        laboratory experience, with permission of the program director.

        These four courses (CHEM 379, PSYCH 336, 338, 339) do not have
        labs. A ten-week summer-research experience can substitute for
        advanced lab experience. Or students taking Chemistry 379 can
        take the corresponding lab course Chemistry 373.
