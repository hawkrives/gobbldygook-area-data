Level III:
    description:
        Every biology major takes at least one level III course in the
        department. Our level III course offerings vary greatly in topic and
        in type of student work, yet they all share aspects such that each
        student has an opportunity to experience sophisticated, independent,
        iterative work in biology. Students in a directed research course will
        practice sophistication in experimental design and practice,
        independence in their investigation, and iterative troubleshooting.
        Students in a non-laboratory investigative course will practice
        sophistication in evaluating the primary literature, as well as
        independence in assembling and synthesizing ideas from that
        literature. Not all level III biology courses meet this requirement.
        Specifically, BIO 394 does not count toward the biology major, and any
        300-level courses worth less than a full credit (BIO 375, and any 0.5
        credit BIO 396 courses) cannot fulfill the Level III requirement.
        Sometimes Level III topics courses in other departments like
        Environmental Studies can count as the Level III biology course.
